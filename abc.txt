To deploy your project on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your project**: Make sure your application is ready for deployment (e.g., Next.js, React, or static site).
2. **Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**: Vercel integrates with these platforms.
3. **Sign up/log in to Vercel**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and create an account.
4. **Import your repository**: Click "New Project" and select your repository.
5. **Configure build settings**: Vercel auto-detects most frameworks. Adjust settings if needed.
6. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy". Vercel will build and deploy your project.
7. **Access your site**: Vercel provides a live URL after deployment.

No Kubernetes or AWS setup is needed for Vercel deployments.
